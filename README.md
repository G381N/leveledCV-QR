# qr-leveled

This project was scaffolded with Next.js (TypeScript) and includes the PixelBlast component added via the `shadcn` CLI.

What I did
- Created a Next.js app at `/home/gebin/Desktop/qr-leveled` (TypeScript, App Router).
- Ran `npx shadcn@latest add @react-bits/PixelBlast-TS-CSS` to add the PixelBlast component.

Files added by shadcn
- `src/components/PixelBlast.tsx`
- `src/components/PixelBlast.css`
- `src/lib/utils.ts`

Quick start

1. Install dependencies (if needed):

```bash
cd /home/gebin/Desktop/qr-leveled
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes
- Tailwind CSS (v4) was detected and used by the shadcn tooling.
- If you want the project at the exact capitalized folder name `QrLeveled`, you can rename the folder later; npm package naming restrictions require a lowercase package name.

If you'd like, I can:
- run the dev server now and show the first-page output
- or commit these changes to git and create a branch
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
